// MARK: - Specification
///
/// This is the primary outward-facing class of the TextFetcher library.  The primary intended use of this library is the retrieval and local caching of bundled or remote text documents.  You can specify a version source, such that only newer versions are retrieved as needed.
///
/// Usage:
///
/// 1. Register any Text Sources you would like fetched and cached via the registerTextSource(_:) method(s).
/// 2. Request Text Sources as needed via the text(for...) method(s), while specifying whether it should allow remote fetching if needed.  If not, it will immediately return the previously cached version or, if none exists, the bundled version instead.
///
/// Optionally:
///
/// 1. (Highly encouraged) Provide a VersionSource to determine which versions are best to fetch and cache, via the setVersionSource(_:) method.
/// 2. Configure the timeout (how long before falling back to bundled or cached versions, if a remote fetch takes too long) via the setTimeout(to:) method.
/// 3. Configure the Application Bunlde to be used for Bundled texts via the setResourceBundle(to:) method.
///
/// - note:  A default instance of this class is provided via the static accessor "default".  This instance should cover nearly every use case, but where separate cache stores are needed a public initializer is provided as well.
///
